# Easylink client
## About
A fast and modern [Easylink](https://github.com/Nextflow-Cloud/easylink) client that supports calls through the Mediasoup RTC library. Made using Preact, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.
## To do
- [ ] Accessibility
- [ ] Responsiveness
## Note
WARNING! The client contains bad practices! Repetitive code will be fixed later. Meanwhile, we are focused on getting it to function. The server is in the process of being rewritten in Rust from TypeScript, so we will need to make changes anyway. Luckily, the only part that was fully implemented was the WebRTC portion. We will be catching up soon.
